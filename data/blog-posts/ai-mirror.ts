Then I found Agree.com.\n\nAgree made e-signature free for everyone‚Ä¶ and then loaded the platform with killer features like automated invoicing, integrated payments, and revenue recovery.\n\nNow I can send, sign, and get paid‚Äîall in one place. No more waiting around for checks or jumping between apps. Agree.com doesn't just save me hundreds of dollars every month; it gets me to the good part faster: seeing money hit my account.\n\nAs a founder myself, I gotta say my favorite part about Agree.com is that their founders are accessible and dialed in to making the product 10x better than the alternative.\n\nI already know you're smart because you read Big Desk Energy. Now you can show others that you're smart because you send contracts with Agree.\n\nUsing Agree.com is an IQ test.",

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Welcome to Ponderer's 30th edition.</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Happy Sunday!</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">How do you make an announcement that has nothing to do with AI in an AI newsletter that is read by people interested in AI?</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Simple, like this:</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Our founder wrote an article with a teardown of our newsletter (you know, mind-blowing stuff ü§Ø) and broke down the power of great design in newsletters‚Äîand why "good content" isn't enough to succeed with newsletters.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>From now on:</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We'll mind our own business and leave design to Pixels.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">If you were one of the awesome people who pre-ordered our beehiiv design course, know that we'll send updates about it via Pixels. üçâ</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Here are 1 idea to ponder, 2 resources to skill up, and 3 tools to try out.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Let's do it.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">PONDER THIS</h2>

    <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"AI is a mirror, reflecting not only our intellect but our values & fears." ‚ÄîRavi Narayanan</blockquote>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The comparison of AI to a mirror implies that AI systems, in their understanding and decision-making processes, may reflect the inherent biases, values, and fears of those who create and wield them.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This suggests that the development and use of AI involves not just technical and scientific considerations, but also moral and ethical ones.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">If AI indeed reflects our values and fears, it becomes imperative to critically examine what we instill in these systems.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">AI's application in sensitive areas such as law enforcement, healthcare, and finance could mirror societal inequalities or prejudices, potentially exacerbating existing issues if not addressed conscientiously.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">If you are building AI systems, we suggest a deeper exploration of the values and ethical principles embedded within AI technologies, pushing for transparency and accountability in their development and deployment.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">As we have mentioned before, we believe true unbiased AI is impossible.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Of course, we could be wrong.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">LEARN</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." ‚Äì Mahatma Gandhi</p>
