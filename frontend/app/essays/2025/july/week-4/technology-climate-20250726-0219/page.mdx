## 1. **Makersite Raises €60M Series B to Transform Product Sustainability**  

Germany-based Makersite has closed a €60 million Series B round to scale its platform that helps companies like Microsoft improve product sustainability during design. Makersite leverages AI-driven simulations and data models to optimize supply chains and ensure products meet environmental standards from conception through production.  

### Strategic Implications:  
- **Sustainability as Differentiator:** With regulations tightening globally around carbon neutrality (e.g., Europe’s Green Deal), Makersite positions itself as a critical partner for enterprises aiming to stay compliant while appealing to eco-conscious consumers.
- **Enterprise Adoption Trends:** Microsoft’s involvement underscores how leading corporations are prioritizing tools that operationalize sustainability goals rather than merely tracking emissions retroactively.

### Market Outlook:  
According to Gartner, 70% of CEOs are expected to mandate ESG-related metrics into organizational performance reviews by 2026—providing fertile ground for platforms like Makersite.
